Is there other code this application depends on?

* DIGITAL ZINE - canva, sort by month (video format)
* choosing puzzle from color palette - (2 games/3 each, randomize difficulty onClick)
* SLIDING PUZZLE GAME - with high scores board. high scores viewable from each game home page? (using button)
* EASTER EGG - hidden onClick that does annoying little window.alert popup

* create webapi to browse photos (not in zine form) - NoSQL (save images to project & save paths/alt/filters to db to render ?)
* custom domain
